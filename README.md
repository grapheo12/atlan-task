# Atlan Backend Internship Task

- TODO: Dockerize

Please run `run_tests.py` to get an interactive shell for testing.
It spawns a thread that runs a counter.
Counter can be paused(command: p), resumed(command: r) and terminated(command: t) at any time.
You can view the counter variable value by running command s (for show).

Please see tests/threadManagerTest.py for reference usage.
The context manager in action is defined in app/threadManager.py.
